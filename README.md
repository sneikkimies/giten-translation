# giten-translation
Ongoing translation project for the 1997 PC game, Giten Megami Tensei: Tokyo Mokushiroku.

This project uses the powerful DLL-hooking tool Textractor to capture messages displayed by the game in real-time, and then translates them via a custom table. While Textractor is most know for its applications in machine translation, none of those features are being used here; all of the translation work has been done by hand.
